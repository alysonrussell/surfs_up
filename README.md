## Suggestion for further analysis

Overall, we see that the temperature difference from opposite times of year really are not that different.  December is on average four degrees cooler, but does have the potential for a lower minimum temperature by almost ten degrees.

The main blindspot we have in our analysis is tourism data - what type of people are visiting the island at different times of year?  These insights can help us determine if enough tourists are visiting in December to sustain an Ice Cream business, and/or if enough December visitors are surfers to keep that business running strong.

We could also look into what type of weather is ideal for surfing conditions to see if there are any major differences between June and December.
